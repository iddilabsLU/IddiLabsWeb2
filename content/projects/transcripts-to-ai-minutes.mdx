## Problem

Meeting minutes are time-consuming to write and often lack consistency. Teams spend hours:
- Reviewing audio or video recordings
- Extracting decisions, action items, and owners
- Formatting minutes for distribution
- Tracking follow-up tasks and deadlines

**Common pain points:**
- Minutes are written days after meetings when context fades
- Action items get buried in unstructured notes
- No standard template means every meeting doc looks different
- Manual extraction of decisions and owners is tedious

## Solution

A local audio-to-minutes processor that:

1. **Transcription** — Upload meeting audio/video for automatic transcription
2. **AI Extraction** — Identify decisions, action items, owners, and deadlines using OpenAI
3. **Template-Based Output** — Generate structured minutes following customizable templates
4. **Offline Processing** — Run entirely on local infrastructure (audio never leaves your environment)
5. **Export Options** — Output to PDF, Word, or structured JSON for integration with task management tools

Designed for teams that value privacy and need consistent, professional meeting documentation.

## Outcomes

- **Time Savings** — Reduce minute-writing from hours to minutes
- **Consistency** — Every meeting follows the same clear structure
- **Actionability** — Decisions and tasks are immediately visible and trackable
- **Privacy-First** — Local processing means sensitive discussions stay internal

**Learnings:** AI excels at structured extraction but requires careful prompt engineering to handle different meeting styles (formal board meetings vs. casual team stand-ups). Template flexibility is key to adoption.
