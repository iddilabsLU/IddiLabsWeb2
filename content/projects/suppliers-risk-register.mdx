## Problem

Financial institutions in Luxembourg face increasing pressure to maintain comprehensive supplier registers that comply with CSSF Circular 22/806 and EBA Guidelines on ICT and Security Risk Management (EBA/GL/2019/02).

**Key challenges:**
- Manual tracking in spreadsheets is error-prone and hard to audit
- Criticality scoring lacks consistency across teams
- Due diligence documentation is scattered
- Regulatory reporting requires significant manual effort

## Solution

An offline-first supplier risk register that helps compliance teams:

1. **Structured Data Collection** — Capture supplier details, contract information, and risk assessments in a standardized format
2. **Automated Criticality Scoring** — Calculate supplier criticality based on CSSF/EBA criteria (business impact, substitutability, data access)
3. **Due Diligence Tracking** — Monitor assessment schedules, document uploads, and review dates
4. **Export & Reporting** — Generate PDF reports and Excel exports for internal reviews and regulatory submissions

Built as a privacy-first tool that runs entirely offline with no external dependencies.

## Outcomes

- **Structured Compliance** — Simplified adherence to CSSF 22/806 requirements
- **Reduced Manual Work** — Automated criticality calculations save hours per assessment
- **Audit-Ready** — Built-in versioning and export capabilities for regulatory reviews
- **Open Source** — Free for any institution to use and adapt

**Learnings:** Balancing regulatory requirements with usability requires deep understanding of both compliance workflows and user needs. Building offline-first reduces complexity and increases trust.
