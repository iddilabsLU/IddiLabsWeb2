## Problem

Compliance teams at Luxembourg financial institutions must monitor CSSF publications constantly:
- New circulars, FAQs, and regulatory updates appear without warning
- Manual monitoring is time-consuming and easy to miss
- Impact assessment requires reading lengthy technical documents
- Teams waste hours tracking changes across multiple CSSF pages

**Pain points:**
- No centralized alert system for CSSF updates
- Initial impact classification is subjective and inconsistent
- Regulatory changes can be buried in dense PDF documents
- Response time suffers when teams learn about updates late

## Solution

An automated regulatory monitoring system that:

1. **Continuous Monitoring** — Polls CSSF website and RSS feeds for new publications
2. **AI Summarization** — Generates concise summaries of circulars, FAQs, and regulatory updates using OpenAI
3. **Impact Classification** — Automatically categorizes updates by relevance (High/Medium/Low impact) based on institution type and business lines
4. **Multi-Channel Alerts** — Sends notifications via email, Slack, or RSS when new content is published
5. **Historical Archive** — Maintains searchable database of all CSSF publications with metadata

Designed to help compliance teams stay ahead of regulatory changes with minimal manual effort.

## Outcomes

- **Zero Missed Updates** — Automated polling ensures nothing slips through
- **Faster Response** — Teams receive alerts within hours of publication
- **Consistent Classification** — AI-driven impact assessment reduces subjectivity
- **Time Savings** — Eliminates daily manual checks of CSSF website

**Learnings:** Regulatory websites lack standardized data feeds, requiring robust scraping and change detection. AI summarization must preserve critical details — brevity can't compromise accuracy. Multi-channel delivery is essential as teams have different notification preferences.
