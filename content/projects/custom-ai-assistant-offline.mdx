## Problem

Regulated financial institutions face a dilemma with AI adoption:
- Cloud-based AI tools expose sensitive data to third parties
- Compliance requirements prohibit external data sharing
- Off-the-shelf solutions lack domain-specific knowledge
- Employees resort to public AI tools, creating security risks

**Key constraints:**
- Data must remain on-premises at all times
- AI responses must be auditable and explainable
- System must integrate with internal knowledge bases
- Need to support 8GB+ RAM environments (typical enterprise hardware)

## Solution

An on-premises AI assistant that organizations can run entirely offline:

1. **Local LLM Deployment** — Uses open-source models via Ollama (Llama, Mistral) that run on standard hardware
2. **Private Training** — Fine-tune on internal documents (policies, procedures, regulatory guides) without data leaving infrastructure
3. **Vector Search Integration** — RAG architecture connects to internal document repositories
4. **Audit Trail** — Log all queries and responses for compliance review
5. **Resource Efficient** — Optimized to run on machines with 8GB+ RAM (no GPU required)

Designed for regulated entities that need AI capabilities without compromising data sovereignty.

## Outcomes

- **Zero External Exposure** — All processing happens on-premises
- **Domain Expertise** — Learns from institution-specific knowledge bases
- **Compliance-Ready** — Built-in logging and audit capabilities
- **Accessible Infrastructure** — Runs on existing enterprise hardware

**Learnings:** Offline LLMs have made enormous strides in capability. Smaller models (7B-13B parameters) can deliver strong results when properly fine-tuned on domain data. Resource optimization is critical — inference speed vs. model size trade-offs must match real-world hardware constraints.
