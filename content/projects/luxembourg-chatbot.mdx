## Problem

Expats and newcomers to Luxembourg face a steep learning curve navigating:
- Tax and social security systems
- Banking and residence permit procedures
- Healthcare and insurance requirements
- Multilingual administrative processes (French, German, Luxembourgish)

**Current challenges:**
- Information is scattered across government websites, forums, and expat groups
- Language barriers make official documentation hard to understand
- Generic chatbots lack Luxembourg-specific context
- No single source for both administrative and everyday living questions

## Solution

A Luxembourg-focused AI assistant that provides:

1. **Contextual Answers** — Trained on Luxembourg-specific datasets (government docs, tax guides, expat forums)
2. **Multilingual Support** — Understands questions in English, French, German, and provides relevant translations
3. **RAG Architecture** — Retrieval-Augmented Generation ensures answers cite current official sources
4. **Topic Coverage** — Handles administrative queries (taxes, visas) and practical living topics (schools, housing, transport)
5. **Hosted Online** — Accessible via web interface due to hardware requirements for model hosting

Built for the Luxembourg community — by someone who understands the unique challenges of living and working here.

## Outcomes

- **Accessible Guidance** — Fast answers to complex administrative questions
- **Language Bridge** — Helps non-French/German speakers navigate official processes
- **Community Resource** — Centralizes knowledge that's currently fragmented across platforms
- **Always Current** — RAG approach means updates reflect latest regulatory changes

**Learnings:** Building effective RAG systems requires careful curation of source data. Luxembourg's multilingual reality demands special handling of language mixing within single queries. Hosted deployment is necessary due to model size — privacy trade-offs must be transparent.
